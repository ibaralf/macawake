# macawake
A workaround for the issue of Macbooks or Mac mini going into sleep mode even if you have the settings configured. This is problematic if you want to have a docker container always running.
This simple python script keeps your PC from going to sleep by moving the mouse every x number of seconds. 

## TO Run
1) Open a mac terminal

2) Clone this git repo

3) Execute the script
  
    $> python3 pyjiggle.py

5) Enter number of seconds for interval between mouse moves.
